                        <p>
                            This project provides a batch script to automate the configuration of ThrottleStop's TPL
                            (Turbo Power Limits), including adjusting PL1, PL2, TTL (Turbo Time Limit), and other
                            settings.
                            It also integrates custom Windows power plans for enhanced CPU power management.

                            This project is a small 2D roguelike survival game developed in Unity using C#. It is
                            designed for a wide audience, including hardcore gamers, survival fans, and casual players.
                            This project took inspiration from the popular game Vampire Survivors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Toward the end of my high education, I chose the theme of my diploma project, which was "2D
                            Game Development". Making this project as a solo developer was quite hard, interesting
                            and fun.This project was made in C# using Unity 2D Game Engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game design mirrors elements from Vampire Survivors, focusing on delivering a unique and
                            challenging experience. The development process involved using Unity's features to implement
                            collision physics, interaction animations, and real-time algorithm optimization. Throughout
                            the development, I explored into advanced techniques within the Unity environment. This
                            included:

                        <p>
                            In this 2D survival game, you begin each run equipped with a randomly assigned weapon. Your
                            goal is to
                            withstand relentless waves of enemies swarming toward you. Defeating enemies rewards you
                            with experience points and,
                            with a 50% chance, coins. The experience you gather allows you to level up, unlocking
                            opportunity to access the upgrade panel, where you can enhance your
                            survival abilities.To improve your survival experience you need to spend coins:

                                <strong>New weapons:</strong> Add more weapons without replacing your current weapon, giving you versatile options for dealing with

                        <h4>Survive as long as possible!</h4>

                        <p>The game currently has no definitive ending. Each attempt is a time-based challenge where your survival duration becomes a score you can share with friends
                        and competitors. Compare your best times and strive to beat their records!</p>
                        <p>
                            Making this game was really hard! It took a lot of time and effort, and I made many mistakes
                            along the way. Sometimes, I
                            even had to start over completely multiple times. But each time I did, I learned something
                            new and made the game better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, this project was made me learn how to make games and how hard it is. It was a
                            fun way to learn about game development and improve my skills. Now, the
                            game is available for people to play on computers and Android phones.
